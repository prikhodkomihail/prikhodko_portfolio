## 🛠️ How to Use Each Section

Each section contains its own README file with detailed instructions. Dependencies are managed separately for each type of test:

1. Navigate to the folder you want to work with.
2. Activate your virtual environment (if not already activated).
3. Install dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the tests as instructed in the folder's README.
